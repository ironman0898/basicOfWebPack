  <h1>Hello This is webpack info to create bundel of application.</h1>
  <h2>Steps To Start (basics)</h2>
  <p>
    1. In package.json create a build script of webpack and run command npm
    run build. it will create main.js in dist
  </p>
  <p>2. Add this file in script tag of html file</p>
  <p>3. Create a js file in src and add some function to it</p>
  <p>4. Import it to index and call function</p>
  <p>
    5. Now delete build and type command npm run build. it will create
    minified version of all files in main.js
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Now run the app on browser and check console. You have created webpack
    bundle appliction which is minified version of application.
  </p>

  <h2>Steps to create webpack config</h2>
  <p>1. Create Webpack config in root folder</p>
  <p>2. Add configs to module.export.</p>
  <p>
    3. Set 'mode' option to 'development' or 'production' to enable defaults
    for each environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Not delete main.js and create another build. now you will see the
    changes in file of main.js.
  </p>

  <h2>Steps to create entry and output for webpack</h2>
  <p>1. Delete old build file from dist main.js</p>
  <p>2. For Understanding remain index file to App.js</p>
  <p>3. In webpack.config.js create to key entry and output keys.</p>
  <p>
    4. Entry point : provide app.js path in entry key. now this file will be
    your entry point for app
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Output point :<br />
    1. Import path package from node to get path of your files.<br />
    2. Create object for output and provide path where we want to create
    minified buldel of application and provide file name for it.<br />3. Now
    replace this file details in script file with main.js
  </p>
  <strong>Now to run minified app you need to delete the old build and again create new build which is very tideous task
    so now we will automeate the process.</strong>

  <h2>Steps to create minified version on every changes done in application. Automating build</h2>
  <p>1. Install webpack-dev-server</p>
  <p>2. Create start script in package json "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open"</p>
  <p>3. In webpack config add devServer key and asign bject which contain the folder name using path.join and add port
    number</p>
  <p>4. use command npm start. your dev server will be stared with webpack try to change function it will use HMR to
    reload changes.</p>

  <h2>Now we will connect this project to host and try to load some content on host</h2>
  <p>1. Create the host project and follow all above steps to create and project with web pack config</p>
  <p>2. Install html-webpack-plugin using npm in both project</p>
  <p>3. In Project 1 <br />1. create content.js file with content to load in host. <br />2. Import that file in App.js
    and create project1Content variable using window to use content globally and asign imported content. <br />3. In
    webpack config import HtmlWebpackPlugin. create plugin key in modules and in array provide templete file path.
    <br />4. Apply cors header in devServer object so that when ever we make changes in project1 content it reflect in
    host immidetly. <br />5. Now module rules that will allow injecting other extension fine in webpack.
  </p>
  <p>4. In Host app <br />1. Create load content function that will load our content in html div. <br />2. In load
    content create a script tag element using dom and provide src of our build file from project1 eg.
    http://localhost:[project1-port-number]/[your-bundel-fileProject1].js apend it in div.<br />3. In
    webpack config import HtmlWebpackPlugin. create plugin key in modules and in array provide templete file path.
    <br />4. Now module rules that will allow injecting other extension fine in webpack.</p>
  <p>5. Now start both project and see magic</p>
